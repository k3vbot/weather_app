# Weather App

In this challenge I used the Openweathermap API and built a weather app. Using the search function the user can search for a city by name, which then is saved to local storage. The user can then click on the city name and they will be presented with the current Temperature, Humidity, Wind speed, and UV Index. They will also be shown the Temp and humidity of the city for the next 5 days.

And this is a screenshot of after the user has searched and clicked on a city.
